**Note to Reviewers:** This anonymous GitHub repository accompanies our paper submission. We chose this format to effectively showcase dynamic visualizations (e.g., animated GIFs) of our forecasting results, which are best understood in motion. The repository is fully anonymized and contains no information that could identify the authors. We thank you for your time and careful consideration in reviewing our work.


This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation for our paper, "Spatiotemporal Forecasting as Planning: A Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Approach with Generative World Models", submitted for review.

Our work introduces SFP, a novel paradigm that reframes spatiotemporal forecasting as a planning problem. By leveraging a Generative World Model to simulate future possibilities and a planning algorithm guided by non-differentiable domain metrics (e.g., CSI, TKE) as reward signals, our framework can directly optimize for the objectives that truly matter in scientific applications.

This code base provides all the necessary components to reproduce the experiments and results presented in our manuscript. Please refer to the instructions below for setup and usage.
