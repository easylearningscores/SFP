ðŸš€ **Note to Reviewers:** This anonymous GitHub repository accompanies our paper submission. We chose this format to effectively showcase dynamic visualizations (e.g., animated GIFs) of our forecasting results, which are best understood in motion. The repository is fully anonymized and contains no information that could identify the authors. We thank you for your time and careful consideration in reviewing our work.


This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation for our paper, "**Spatiotemporal Forecasting as Planning: A Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Approach with Generative World Models**", submitted for review.
